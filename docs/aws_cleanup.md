# üßπ AWS VPC Cleanup Script

A command-line tool to **find and delete AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)** and their associated dependencies.  

The script systematically removes components such as **Security Groups, Route Tables, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, and Network ACLs** before deleting the VPC itself.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This script is **powerful** and can permanently delete your AWS infrastructure.  

- It **does not terminate active resources** like **EC2 instances, RDS databases, or Lambda functions** inside the VPC.  
- If such resources exist, the script will fail.  
- Always run in **`--dry-run` mode first** before enabling deletion.  

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3** (required)  
- **Boto3** (AWS SDK for Python)  

```sh
pip install boto3
```

- **AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials. The simplest way is with the AWS CLI:  

```sh
aws configure
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

The script supports three modes: **Find-Only (default)**, **Dry Run**, and **Delete**.  

### 1. üîç Find Mode (Default)

Lists VPCs and their dependencies that match your criteria without making any changes.  

```sh
python3 vpc_cleanup.py --name-contains <vpc-name-substring> --region <aws-region>
```

**Example:**  

```sh
python3 vpc_cleanup.py --name-contains test-rc-xxxxx-vpc --region us-east-2
```

---

### 2. üß™ Dry Run Mode (Simulated Deletion)

Simulates deletion by showing what would be removed, without actually deleting anything.  
Highly recommended before running in delete mode.  

```sh
python3 vpc_cleanup.py --name-contains <vpc-name-substring> --region <aws-region> --delete --dry-run
```

---

### 3. üíÄ Delete Mode (Permanent Deletion)

Deletes the specified VPC and all its dependencies.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Use with **extreme caution**.  

```sh
python3 vpc_cleanup.py --name-contains <vpc-name-substring> --region <aws-region> --delete
```
